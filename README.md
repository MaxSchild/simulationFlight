This project will include programmes to simulate a flight of a 1U CubeSat.  
The attributes such as the position of the CubeSat will be stored in classes, which are defined external in this project and objects of the classes are initialized in the "mainProgramm.py".

The attributes are:
-position of the CubeSat(with x,y,z coordinates)
-angular velocity of the CubeSat
-attitude of the CubeSat

In next steps we will try to "control" the Cubeat by influencing the angular velocity and the attitude of the CubeSats by simulating how the CubeSat would behave if we would put a current on the Magnetorquers.

Also we will try to work with a 3D object of the Earth and to simulate the camera during a flight.

This data will be used to analyze and create models for the whole attitude control.
